### Description
An algorithm is a set of instructions, typically solve a class of problems or perform a computation. Algorithms are unambiguous specifications for performing calculation, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.

As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.

Here you can find short descriptions and examples for the most common data structures and algorithms. You can review a code, find a solution for your task, test it, etc.

#### PS.
Don't forget to take a look at the [interview tasks](https://github.com/curdwithraisins/algoraisins/tree/master/raisins) from the verity of companies! :wink:

#### How to:
* run code: ``npm start ${PATH}``
* test algorithm: ``npm test ${PATH}``
* check all test suits: ``npm run test-all``
